# E-commerce-web
Trabajo Practico 3 del bootcamp Ada 

This is a simple e-commerce web based on the design of my previous one: https://malerey.github.io/avadefaye/index.html
It's built on Node, Express, and jQuery. The design uses Bootstrap and Sass. 

The task was to create a webpage with Node where an Admin could add products for sale. 

To run the app, download all files and run the following commands:

# npm install
# npm start 

The website runs on port 3000. To add a new product, login as admin (user and password are both "admin") and add the name, an image and the price of the product. 
On returning to the homepage, you'll be able the see the added products.
